I am a senior undergraduate student at University of Michigan, major in Data Science. Concurrently, I am also dual majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests lie in artificial intelligence and trustworthy AI. Recently, my research focuses on natural language processing and multimodal deep learning, with an emphasis on trustworthiness, interpretability, and efficiency. In particular, I am interested in two broad directions:

1. **Alignment of Modalities for AI preception:** Enhancing AI perception through multi-modal deep learning by improving reliability, interpretability, and efficiency.
2. **Attributional & Mechanistic Interpretability of Models:** Understanding the behaviors of LLMs and VLMs, in terms of the effects of their training data and underlying mechanisms.
